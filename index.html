        <p>
          The creative prompt I have chosen is skeuomorphism, and the technique I have
          chosen to implement is date/time: Date.now(). In this project, I will
          attempt to build a skeuomorphic interface of a vinyl record player
          that will play different variations of a song depending of the time of
          day the user is in. The design of the vinyl record will also
          be be changed every time the song variation changes. <br /><br />
          The track I am using is  <a href="https://share.google/KEO7wb6ITXWYuCNav">'June Time' by Patrick Patrikios</a>, which is free
          to use with the YouTube Audio Library licence. I will be editing the
          different variations of the song with Reaper. There will be 3
          variations in total.
          <br /><br />
          The visual direction of the project is greatly inspired by
          <a href="https://cari.institute/aesthetics/nu-brutalism">nu-brutalism</a>, which is characterised by high contrast elements and blocky layouts. While the interface will closely replicate the look
          and functionality of a real record player, it will be designed in a
          minimalist vector style. I will be using Adobe Illustrator to illustrate the
          vector elements before importing them into Visual Studio Code.

          For this particular project, I was not inspired by any other existing
          interfaces, but rather the idea stemmed from my deep interest in album
          and record design, which eventually lead me to think of creating a
          digital turntable that could blend modernism and nostalgia,
          and emulate the peacefulness and warmth of a physical record player. 
          Hence, I thought that the simplicity and timnelessness of the nu-brutralism style would complement this project.
          I did a search online of vinyl players for reference, and simplified them into 2D
          vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator.   
          <br /><br />
          Although the interface is meant to be skeuomorphic, I intentionally omitted a few of the interactive features found on turntables. This was because I wanted to set realistic goals that I could achieve with the timeframe of this assignment. However, these features will still be included in the turntable illustration. The features that I chose to make interactive were the more important and intuitive ones that people are likely to look for when they encounter the interface, 
          such as the start and stop button and the volume slider. The unique element that I am adding to the interface is the ambient sound button that can be toggled on and off, which is a feature (as far as I am aware of) does not exist in physical turntables. This boasts the exciting capabilities of skeuomorphic design that mixes physical technology with digital coding.
          <br /><br />After the week 8
          lesson, I felt like I should help users learn how to operate my
          interface, even though my intention was to encourage them to explore and
          experience the interface with as little instruction as possible. I
          decided to add an information button that would not stand out too much, but that all users who are exploring the interface would
          inevitably interact with.

        <p>

          I chose this track 'June Time' by Patrick Patrikios as it had the chill and relaxed vibe I was looking for 
          to complement the tone of the project. 
          To create the music variations of ‘June Time’, I used Reaper to alter the tempo
          and pitch of the original track, and added my own MIDI instrument
          layers. This part of the process was challenging for me because I have
          never tried making any sort of ‘remix’ before, but I think that I managed to get
        the tracks to a satisfactory standard, and will use one of these remixes in the user-testing prototype.

        <p>
          During the <a href="https://interfacedesign.netlify.app/" target="_blank" >peer user testing</a>, I was still solving the bugs for the
          following functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start/Stop Button will toggle rotation of the vinyl</li>
          <li>Volume Slider will control the volume of the main audio</li>
          <li>Ambient sound button will reflect active state</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I also had yet to work on the code for the date() functions, but I got
          the front-end of the interface looking more or less like what I have
          planned for the final output for 1 of the variations. As such, the questions I have prepared for
          the testing was for me to find out if users are able to grasp the
          intention of the project, which is to explore, experiment and enjoy a
          laidback  audio listening session, just from the design and foundational features of the prototype. <br />
          <br /><br />The two questions were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Did the page make you curious what the page and audio would be like
            during different parts of the day?
          </li>
          <li>
            Did the page encourage you to interact with the controllers? How
            intuitive was it for you to use?
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h1 class="h1-padded">Feedback and Response</h1>
      <div class="div-type">

      
        <span class="question">[ question 1 ]</span>
         <span class="p-question">Did the page make you curious what the page and audio would be like
          during different parts of the day?</span>

          <p>Most testers have indicated that they are curious about how the
          interface would look like during different times of the day, and I am very 
          happy that my interface has suceeded in this key aspect.
          
          <br><br>

          A few testers have suggested that I should display the time adaptation
          feature more prominantly, such as indicating it on the opening modal
          or displaying the time and date somewhere on the interface. I think
          these suggestions are great, and will try to implement a current time
          display into the interface that would as a hint to the user that time plays 
          a key role in the interface. I will also reconsider the copy I currently have in the information pop-up dialog.

          <br><br>

          Another piece of feedback I received from a tester was that I should consider putting the music on loop, 
          as they felt disengaged when the song had stopped before they had left the interface. I agree 
          that this is an oversight on my end, and will add loop into the audio controls.

          <br><br>
          One tester has also suggested that the colour variations complement the mood and vibe of its
          corresponding time of day, which was something I had been personally been thinking of before the testing, and will definately implement as I design the remaining vinyl disks.</p>

          <br><br>

          <span class="question">[ question 2 ]</span>
          <span class="p-question">Did the page encourage you to interact with the controllers? How
            intuitive was it for you to use?</span>
            <p> Understandably, since I could not get a couple of the controls ready for the testing because of the errors,
              many testers indicated the lack of controls they could interact with on the interface. 
              On the positive side, most testers said that the interface was intuitive and said they were curious to explore all the controls available!

            <br><br>

            One tester who found the interface not intuitive suggested that the interactive areas be highlighted
            in a different colour to make it more obvious to the user what they should be interacting with.
            While I understand and appreciate the perspective of this tester, I thought that the ambiguity of which controls
            are fixed and which are interactive plays into the air of mystery I wanted to create for this interface, 
            that would propel the users' curiousity, and encourage them to explore the controls on their own. However, I do agree that I could have more visual feedback
            to improve user engagement. I could possibly do this by creating hover and active effects for the elements that the users interact with. 
            
            <br><br>

            Some users also pointed out that they were unsure what the ambient sound button function was. This was understandable as I could not get the active state of the element working in time, and the button was not labelled either. 
            While the ambient sound could be successfully toggled through the button, I realised that becasue the volume of the main audio track was too loud, and thus the testers were unable to observe the change in audio when they interacted with the button. 
            To ameliorate this, I will adjust the volume of the main audio track down when the ambient sound is activated, so that the feedback from the function would be more obvious.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <div class="div-type">
        <p>
          Since the user testing, I have fixed two of the errors: the start and stop button now succesfully stops the rotation of 
          the disk, and the volume slider is also working like it should. I have also reduced the volume of the main audio for the ambient sound toggle button, so that the ambient
          sound can be more easily heard. I will be implementing the response actions to the feedback mentioned above in addition to
          creating the date.now() features I have planned in my system map. I will also complete the other design and css styling variations required, as well as source the rest of the ambient sounds I want to include.
          It was really great to get fresh and unbiased perspectives on my project through the user-testing exercise, 
          and I truly value the effort that has been made by my peers to provide me with feedback that is constructive and actionable.
          While I was conscious of the shortcomings of the prototype going into the user-testing, 
          I came out of the experience feeling more confident about completing the project, as I can see that people are able to understand my concept and intention behind the project 
          and had fun engaging with it.
