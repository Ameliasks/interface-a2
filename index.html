          The prompt I have chosen is Skeuomorphism, and the technique I have
          chosen to utilise is date/time : Date.now(). In this project, I will
          attempt to build a skeuomorphic interface of a vinyl record player
          that will play different variations of a song depending of the time of
          day the user is currently in. The design of the vinyl record will also
          be be changed every time the song variation changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          The track I am using is June Time by Patrick Patrikios, which is free
          to use with the YouTube Audio Library licence. I will be editing the
          different variations of the song with Reaper. There will be 3
          variations in total: original, slowed-down and sped-up.
          <br /><br />
          From an aesthetic perspective, this project is greatly inspired by
          nu-brutalism, so while the interface will closely replicate the look
          and functionality of a real record player, it will be designed in a
          minimalist style. I will be using Adobe Illustrator to illustrate the
          vector elements before importing them into Visual Studio Code.
          <br />
          <br />
          To create the edits of ‘June Time’, I used Reaper to alter the tempo
          and pitch of the original track, as well as add my own MIDI instrument
          layers. This part of the process was challenging for me because I have
          never tried making any sort of ‘remix’ before.
