        <p>
          The prompt I have chosen is Skeuomorphism, and the technique I have
          chosen to utilise is date/time : Date.now(). In this project, I will
          attempt to build a skeuomorphic interface of a vinyl record player
          that will play different variations of a song depending of the time of
          day the user is currently in. The design of the vinyl record will also
          be be changed every time the song variation changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          The track I am using is June Time by Patrick Patrikios, which is free
          to use with the YouTube Audio Library licence. I will be editing the
          different variations of the song with Reaper. There will be 3
          variations in total: original, slowed-down and sped-up.
          <br /><br />
          From an aesthetic perspective, this project is greatly inspired by
          nu-brutalism, so while the interface will closely replicate the look
          and functionality of a real record player, it will be designed in a
          minimalist style. I will be using Adobe Illustrator to illustrate the
          vector elements before importing them into Visual Studio Code.
          <br />
          <br />
          To create the edits of ‘June Time’, I used Reaper to alter the tempo
          and pitch of the original track, as well as add my own MIDI instrument
          layers. This part of the process was challenging for me because I have
          never tried making any sort of ‘remix’ before.

      <p>For this particular project, I was not inspired by any other existing interfaces, but rather the idea stemmed from my deep interest in album and record design, which eventually lead me to think of creating a digital vinyl record player that could blend modernism and nostalgia, and emulate the peacefulness and warmth of a physical record player. I did a search online of vinyl players, and simplified them into 2D vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator.
        <br><br>After the week 8 lesson, I felt like I should help users learn how to operate my interface, even if I wanted to encourage them to explore and experience the interface with as little instruction as possible.
     I decided to add an information button that would not stand out to the user too much, but that all users who explore the interface would inevitably interact with.

        <p> During the peer user testing, I was still solving the bugs for the following functions: </p> 
          <ul>
          <li>Start/Stop Button will toggle rotation of the vinyl</li>
          <li>Volume Slider will control the volume of the main audio</li>
          <li>Ambient sound button should reflect active state</li></ul>

       <p>I also had yet to work on the code for the date() functions, but I got the front-end of the interface looking more or less like what I have planned for the final output for 1 of the 3 variations, and thought it was ready for user-testing. As such, the questions I have prepared for the testing was for me to find out if users are able to grasp the intention of the project, which is to explore, experiment and have a laidback and peaceful audio listening session. 
        <br> <br><br>The two questions were:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Did the page make you curious what the page and audio would be like during different parts of the day</li>
        <li>Did the page encourage you to interact with the controllers? How intuitive was it for you to use?</li></ul>
       

        <p>
          <h1 class="h1-padded">Feedback and Response</h1>

         <p> Most testers have indicated that they are curious about how the interface would look like during different times of the day.
A few testers have suggested that I should display the time adaptation feature more prominantly, such as indicating it on the opening modal or displaying the time and date somewhere on the interface.
I think these suggestions are great, and will try to implement a current time display into the interface.</p>
